        <article>
          <p>
            Messi would begin the 2004–05 season as a guaranteed starter for the
            Barcelona B team and he promoted to the first team by manager Frank
            Rijkaard. He made his La Liga debut for Barcelona on 16 October 2004
            against Espanyol, and scored his first senior goal on 1 May 2005
            against Albacete, from an assist by Ronaldinho, becoming at that
            time the youngest-ever scorer for the club. <br /><br />

            At the beginning of the 2008–09 season, his first under Barcelona's
            new manager, former captain Pep Guardiola, Messi was given the
            number 10 shirt. Over time, he effectively became the tactical focal
            point of Guardiola's possession-based system, increasing his
            goalscoring rate as a result. <br /><br />

            For the start of the 2012–13 season, A double scored against Real
            Betis saw Messi becoming Barcelona's all-time top scorer in La Liga,
            and surpassed Gerd Müller's record of most goals scored in a
            calendar year; Messi would score a record 91 goals in all
            competitions for Barcelona and Argentina throughout 2012.
            <br /><br />

            Messi dedicated most of his career to Barcelona and he won 35
            trophies in 17 years. This includes 10 La Liga titles, 7 Copa del
            Rey titles, 8 Spanish Super Cups, 4 Champions League titles, 3
            European Super Cups, and 3 World Club Championships.

        <h2>International Career Highlights</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            Messi would make his debut with the senior national team in 2005, at
            age 18, coming off the bench in a friendly against Hungary. His
            World Cup debut came in the 2006 FIFA World Cup as a substitute in
            the 74th minute against Serbia and Montenegro, scoring the final
            goal in their victory. This made him the youngest player to
            represent and score for Argentina in the World Cup. <br /><br />

            Messi would finally end Argentina's 28-year trophy drought in the
            2021 Copa América, as they had not won an international tournament
            since 1993. In the process, Argentina defeated Brazil in the final;
            Messi was directly involved in nine out of the 12 goals scored by
            Argentina, scoring four and assisting five, and was named the player
            of the tournament. <br /><br />

            He captained Argentina to win another international trophy in the
            2022 Finalissima against UEFA Euro 2020 winners Italy, where he was
            named player of the match after providing two assists.<br /><br />

            At the 2022 FIFA World Cup, Messi led Argentina to its first World
            Cup victory in 36 years, defeating France during the final. He
            became the first player to score in every stage of the World Cup,
            having scored seven total with three assists, and also the first to
            win the Golden Ball for the tournament twice. With his appearance in
            the final, Messi set new records as the player with the most
            appearances at the World Cup (26) and most direct goal contributions
            at the World Cup (21 – 13 goals and 8 assists). He also set the
            record for most goals for Argentina in a calendar year with 18.
